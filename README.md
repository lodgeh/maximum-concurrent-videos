## Given information about streaming video plays, find the maximum number of video plays that were playing concurrently.   

Write Scala, Java or Python code that accepts a finite collection of video play records and returns the maximum that were playing at once.

You can assume:
all end times are after their corresponding start time
each play lasts at most a few hours
all of the plays happen within one calendar month

The following pseudocode describes some criteria to get you started.
```
VideoPlay
    startTime : an instant in time
    endTime   : an instant in time
```
Please present your solution as you would a production piece of code.
